Mechanical stiffness of glycan strands and peptides:

! We define the energy Unit E0 = 1E-20 Joules.
! Here we define a Length_Unit L0 = 1 nm.
! JC all-atom MD parameter for glycan: Kg=383 E0/L0^2, bond_length= 2.03 L0
! Here we use a Worm-like chain model for peptide: F = -(K_b*T/P)*(1/(4(1-x/L_c)**2)-1/4+x/L_c)
! where P is the persistence length ~ 0.313 nm. L_c is the contour length ~ 3.55 nm.
! Then the stiffness is define: K = K_b*T/P/L_c = 0.372 E0
! To model each disaccharide as one bead, spring constant is doubled and relaxed length is reduced in half.
